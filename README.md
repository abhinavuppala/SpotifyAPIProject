## How it works

On the home screen, users choose any musical artist, plus their desired difficulty & strikes in game, allowing them to customize the difficulty of the game to their liking.
In game, users can guess either a single letter/number or the entire phrase, just like in hangman. They can either use the input box or the on-screen keyboard, which updates the key
colors as the user guesses a character to indicate a correct/incorrect guess.
